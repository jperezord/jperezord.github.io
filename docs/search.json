It also includes the development of the predictive models used for outbreak prediction and the results obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book was written with the Quarto publishing system and hosted at https://jperezord.github.io/ using Github pages."

    "text": "Transmission of the virus occurs primarily through exhalation of very small respiratory droplets and particles that contain the virus even when the infected person has no symptoms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infected people are apparently most contagious just before symptoms appear (about two days before) and in the first phase of the disease [link]. Said respiratory particles can be inhaled by people and/or deposit on their eyes, nose or mouth.\nThe current measures that governments are taking to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 and support the economic recovery of the countries seem to have a tendency towards coexistence with the virus. This strategy is mainly supported by the high vaccination rate that minimizes the potential health effects of the virus. Given this scenario, obtaining a prediction model that includes factors considered key in transmission will be vital for proper optimization of the health system’s resources.\nThe main objective of this work will be the use of machine learning techniques applied to time series for the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks. For this, meteorological data and mobility data will be used, detailing demographic factors as far as possible.\n\nObjetives\nThe main objectives are:\n\nIdentify whether meteorological and mobility factors are important in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks.\nUse of machine learning and time series prediction techniques for modeling the evolution of the virus.\n\nFor which, it will be necessary to achieve a series of secondary objectives:\n\nIdentification of relevant data and study of the possibilities they offer.\nUnderstand the behavior of the virus by analyzing the medical literature Identification of machine learning and prediction techniques that best suit the purpose of our project."

It comes from the individualised declaration of COVID-19 cases to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) through the SiViEs computer application.\nIn SiViEs, all reported cases are accounted for, following the surveillance strategy in force at the time (Strategy for early detection, surveillance and control of COVID-19 available at https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf\nIn the current work, we will use two datasets from CNE:\n\ncasos_tecnica_provincia.csv: Number of cases by diagnostic technique and province (of residence)\ncasos_hosp_uci_def_sexo_edad_provres.csv: Number of hospitalisations, number of admissions to ICU and number of deaths by sex, age and province of residence."

Foreign numbered phones are excluded, usually mobiles in the hands of tourists which operate in Spain while roaming.\nData is available in the Spanish National Institute of Statistics in the following link. It is also provided a link for direct access to the download portal via queries.\nData can be downloaded in different formats. We recommend using ‘CSV: separado por ;’.\n\n\nGoogle data\nThe data published at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/?hl=en-GB offers information related to mobility using the Google ecosystem application services such as Android.\nThe dataset information is available worldwide. In our case, only the information relating to Spain was extracted.\nThe Google Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, supermarkets and pharmacies, parks, public transport, workplaces and residential.\nEach Community Mobility Report is broken down by location and displays the change in visits to places.\nData provided by Google:\n\nRegion_Mobility_Report_CSVs.zip contains worldwide information\n20XX_ES_Region_Mobility_Report.csv contains information for Spain.

    "text": "In addition to time series regression models and exponential smoothing, ARIMA provides another approach to time series forecasting.\nThe main objective of ARIMA models is to describe the autorrelations in the data, while exponential smoothing aim to describe the trend and seasonality in the data.\nDepending on how statistical properties vary over the time, series can be stationary (not depend on time observed) or non-sationary (those with trends or with seasonality).\nIn general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term since we cannot be sure where the peaks and troughs of the cycles will be.\nAre covid series stationary?\nFor covid outbreaks, and according to what we have seen in the visual section, the cycles seems aperiodic. They could be caused when the level of infections is out of control and the containment policies in place are not sufficient. Then the implementation of additional policies against the spread of the virus allows the level of infection to decrease again.\nACF plots are useful for identifying what kind of time series we are facing. For a stationary time series, the ACF will drop to zero relatively quickly, while the ACF of non-stationary data decreases slowly. ACF is an (complete) auto-correlation function which gives us values of auto-correlation of any series with its lagged values while PACF is a partial auto-correlation function. Basically instead of finding correlations of present with lags like ACF, it finds correlation of the residuals (which remains after removing the effects which are already explained by the earlier lag(s)) with the next lag value hence ‘partial’ and not ‘complete’ as we remove already found variations before we find the next correlation.\nOn the other hand, STL is a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series that we will apply in one of the sections."
