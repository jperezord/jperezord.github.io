It also includes the development of the predictive models used for outbreak prediction and the results obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book was written with the Quarto publishing system and hosted at https://jperezord.github.io/ using Github pages."

    "text": "Transmission of the virus occurs primarily through exhalation of very small respiratory droplets and particles that contain the virus even when the infected person has no symptoms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infected people are apparently most contagious just before symptoms appear (about two days before) and in the first phase of the disease [link]. Said respiratory particles can be inhaled by people and/or deposit on their eyes, nose or mouth.\nThe current measures that governments are taking to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 and support the economic recovery of the countries seem to have a tendency towards coexistence with the virus. This strategy is mainly supported by the high vaccination rate that minimizes the potential health effects of the virus. Given this scenario, obtaining a prediction model that includes factors considered key in transmission will be vital for proper optimization of the health system’s resources.\nThe main objective of this work will be the use of machine learning techniques applied to time series for the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks. For this, meteorological data and mobility data will be used, detailing demographic factors as far as possible.\n\nObjetives\nThe main objectives are:\n\nIdentify whether meteorological and mobility factors are important in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks.\nUse of machine learning and time series prediction techniques for modeling the evolution of the virus.\n\nFor which, it will be necessary to achieve a series of secondary objectives:\n\nIdentification of relevant data and study of the possibilities they offer.\nUnderstand the behavior of the virus by analyzing the medical literature Identification of machine learning and prediction techniques that best suit the purpose of our project."

It comes from the individualised declaration of COVID-19 cases to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) through the SiViEs computer application.\nIn SiViEs, all reported cases are accounted for, following the surveillance strategy in force at the time (Strategy for early detection, surveillance and control of COVID-19 available at https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf\nIn the current work, we will use two datasets from CNE:\n\ncasos_tecnica_provincia.csv: Number of cases by diagnostic technique and province (of residence)\ncasos_hosp_uci_def_sexo_edad_provres.csv: Number of hospitalisations, number of admissions to ICU and number of deaths by sex, age and province of residence."

Foreign numbered phones are excluded, usually mobiles in the hands of tourists which operate in Spain while roaming.\nData is available in the Spanish National Institute of Statistics in the following link. It is also provided a link for direct access to the download portal via queries.\nData can be downloaded in different formats. We recommend using ‘CSV: separado por ;’.\n\n\nGoogle data\nThe data published at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/?hl=en-GB offers information related to mobility using the Google ecosystem application services such as Android.\nThe dataset information is available worldwide. In our case, only the information relating to Spain was extracted.\nThe Google Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, supermarkets and pharmacies, parks, public transport, workplaces and residential.\nEach Community Mobility Report is broken down by location and displays the change in visits to places.\nData provided by Google:\n\nRegion_Mobility_Report_CSVs.zip contains worldwide information\n20XX_ES_Region_Mobility_Report.csv contains information for Spain.
