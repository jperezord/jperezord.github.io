# Task 1: Data acquisition and exploration {#sec-data}

## COVID-19

### CNE data

The data published in the [CNE COVID-19 Panel](https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#distribuci%C3%B3n-geogr%C3%A1fica) offers information related to infections, recoveries and deaths reported by local and regional governments in Spain. It comes from the individualised declaration of COVID-19 cases to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) through the SiViEs computer application.

In SiViEs, all reported cases are accounted for, following the surveillance strategy in force at the time (Strategy for early detection, surveillance and control of COVID-19 available at <https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/COVID19_Estrategia_vigilancia_y_control_e_indicadores.pdf>

In the current work, we will use two datasets from CNE:

-   casos_tecnica_provincia.csv: Number of cases by diagnostic technique and province (of residence)

-   casos_hosp_uci_def_sexo_edad_provres.csv: Number of hospitalisations, number of admissions to ICU and number of deaths by sex, age and province of residence.

## Mobility data

### INE data



### Google data

The data published at <https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/?hl=en-GB> offers information related to mobility using the Google ecosystem application services such as Android.

The dataset information is available worldwide. In our case, only the information relating to Spain was extracted.

The Google Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, supermarkets and pharmacies, parks, public transport, workplaces and residential.

Each Community Mobility Report is broken down by location and displays the change in visits to places.

Data provided by Google:

-   Region_Mobility_Report_CSVs.zip contains worldwide information

-   20XX_ES_Region_Mobility_Report.csv contains information for Spain. Note: information is provided by year in separate files.
